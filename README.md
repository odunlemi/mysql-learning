# MySQL Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning MySQL, covering basic, intermediate, and advanced topics. Below is an outline of the topics I've studied in each series.

## Basic Series

- Introduction to databases and MySQL
- Installing and setting up MySQL
- Creating and managing databases
- Creating, altering, and dropping tables
- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- WHERE clause and basic filtering
- Sorting results with ORDER BY
- Limiting results with LIMIT

## Intermediate Series

- JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER)
- Subqueries
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Working with dates and times
- String functions and manipulations
- Indexes and their importance
- Views

## Advanced Series

- Stored procedures and functions
- Triggers
- Transactions and ACID properties
- Query optimization techniques
- Partitioning
- Replication basics
- Security and user management
- Backup and recovery strategies

## Projects and Exercises

Throughout my learning journey, I worked with two main datasets to practice and apply the concepts I learned:

Parks and Recreation Database: This sample database was provided as part of the learning series. It contains information about employees and their departments. I used this database to practice every topic covered in the basic, intermediate, and advanced series.
MyWind Database: This is a MySQL version of the Microsoft Access 2010 Northwind sample database. It provided a more complex, real-world-like dataset to work with. The MyWind database can be found at https://github.com/dalers/mywind.

For each of these databases, I:

Practiced writing queries of increasing complexity
Implemented database design principles
Experimented with performance optimization techniques
Created and managed views, stored procedures, and triggers
Simulated real-world scenarios to solve business problems using SQL

These practical exercises helped reinforce the theoretical concepts and gave me hands-on experience in working with MySQL in different contexts.
